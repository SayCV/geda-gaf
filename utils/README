    gsch2pcb 
    Bill Wilson
  
    gsch2pcb is conceptually based on the gschem2pcb shell script
    distributed with gnetlist, but additionally handles multiple
    schematics, handles element file footprints, and removes pc board
    elements corresponding to components deleted from the schematics.
    It also forward annotates component value changes.

    Please see the README.gsch2pcb file for more information.  Also see
    examples/gsch2pcb/project.sample for an example of a project file.
